Solaris apparently has a VERY slow getusage() system call,
and Otter calls that a LOT to time various operations.

When compiling Otter on Solaris, we HIGHLY recommend disabling
most of the timing by running the following command.

  % make solaris-all

If you compile any other way (on Solaris) make sure that the
C compiler gets the flag '-DTP_NO_CLOCKS'.
