/**
 * This is the m,n,k-game board class. This is a generalization of m x n games in which the
 * players are trying to get k pieces in a row. For example, 3, 3, 3 is Tic-Tac-Toe.
 * 15, 15, 5 would by Go-Moku. for Go-Moku, there are 15x15 intersections on the board. This code
 * would have to be augmented for the inclusion of the 'standard rule' that prevents overlines
 * (a row of 6 or more pieces being a win).
 *
 * Similar changes would be for Connect 4 (7, 7, 4) in which the move generation is limited to
 * dropping.
 *
 * The other extension is the m,n,k,p,q-game which adds placing p stones a move, and the first
 * player only starts with placing q stones. Connect6 is m,n,6,2,1.
 *
 * J. W. H. M. Uiterwijk and H. J van der Herik, The advantage of the initiative, Information Sciences 122 (1) (2000) 43-58.
 *
 * Stochastic, hidden information changes include:
 * phantom m,n,k-game in which the opponents piece locations are unknown (Whitehouse, et. al)
 * Dice in which a dice is rolled to determine which row for X or which column for O the player can place their piece.
 *  In Dice, n=m=k, testing was for 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17. (Houk, 2004)
