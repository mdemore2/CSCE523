# CSCE523 - Intro to Artificial Intelligence
Dr. Gilbert Peterson

This course presents the major principles and techniques of artificial intelligence. Specifically, in-depth studies of core issues such as knowledge representation and problem identification, formulation, and solving are pursued. Topics include knowledge-representation (models of logic, predicate calculus, production-rules, semantic networks, symbolic and subsymbolic representations), problem-solving (search, theorem-proving, reasoning), and knowledge-based systems (expert systems, natural language processing, vision, planning).
